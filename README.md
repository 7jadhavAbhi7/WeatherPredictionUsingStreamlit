# Weather Prediction Using Streamlit

This project is a web application built with Streamlit that predicts weather conditions based on historical data. It utilizes machine learning models to forecast various weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, etc.

## Overview

The web application provides users with an intuitive interface to input their location and select the date for which they want to forecast the weather. Behind the scenes, the application retrieves historical weather data for the specified location and date, preprocesses the data, and feeds it into a trained machine learning model to make predictions.

## Features

- **Location Selection**: Users can enter their location (city, country) to fetch weather data for that specific area.
- **Date Selection**: Users can choose the date for which they want to predict the weather.
- **Prediction Display**: The application displays the predicted weather conditions for the selected location and date, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, etc.
- **Visualization**: Additionally, the application may provide visualizations such as graphs or charts to illustrate the predicted weather trends.
